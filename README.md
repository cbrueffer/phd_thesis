# Latex Sources for my PhD Thesis *RNA Sequencing for Molecular Diagnostics in Breast Cancer*

This repository houses the Latex sources for my PhD thesis entitled *RNA Sequencing for Molecular Diagnostics in Breast Cancer*, written at the Lund University Faculty of Medicine.

The thesis was written in [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) and is based on an [Overleaf template by Daniel Carrera](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/template-for-phd-thesis-template-for-astronomy-at-lund-university/dppmypbdngjv), which in turn is based on / inspired by the official [Lund University Media-Tryck Latex template](https://www.mediatryck.lu.se/en/phd-students).
